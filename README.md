# Okteto Docker Extension

Remote Development Environments for your Docker Compose applications.

## Overwiew

Do you love Docker Desktop, but your application is starting to get too big for your local machine? The Okteto Docker Desktop extension is exactly what you need. Get the Docker Desktop experience you love without the restrictions of having to run everything on your local machine.

## Try It Out Yourself!

Using the Okteto Docker Desktop is very simple. Once you have the extension installed, simply point it to the location of the Docker compose file describing your services and click the "Launch Remote Environment" button! In a matter of minutes, all the services you require should be up and running in the cloud.
